# BeAM Lasercutting Queue
This project is intended to improve the organization, implementation, and functionality of the Laser Cutter. Students wanting to get in line for the Laser Cutter can add their names to the queue at the top. Employees will then check you off as you meet the proper requirements to move forward in the queue. Those three requirements are correct design, correct test run on the UCP software, and proper amount of material. When some one is put on the laser cutter, their name can be removed from the queue and the employees can refer to the top of the list to see who is next.
